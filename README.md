## Information to take into account

As the api does not provide the possibility to fetch a limited number of characters per book, I voluntarily limited `the number of characters displayed to 20`, in order to reduce the number of requests sent.

I used the `react-query` library in order to use their caching system.

For styling, I used `tailwind`.

Thank you for your review.
